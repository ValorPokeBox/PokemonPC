# Welcome to Valor's PokeBox
### By trying to replicate the Pokemon Storage PC that's commonly found all Pokemon centers in the video games, we hope that this a fun way to explore the 18 different Pokemon types that exist in the Pokemon universe.
By selecting a Pokemon typing from the form, you'll be generating a Pokemon box full of Pokemon that share that typing. You can click on each indiviual Pokemon to have them showcased and view specific details about them. If you don't like the Pokemon for whatever reason, you can also release them which will remove them from the box. Happy exploring!

_This project was done by following certain guidelines which were mainly to: fetch a collection of resources (and render them) and fetch more details about a single one of those resources._
